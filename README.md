### LSTM
Implementation of [LSTM](https://github.com/xga0/YelpNLP/blob/master/lstm.py) for sentimental analysis on Yelp reviews.

Long Short Term Memory networks, usually called “LSTMs” , were introduced by Hochreiter and Schmiduber. These have widely been used for speech recognition, language modeling, sentiment analysis and text prediction.
